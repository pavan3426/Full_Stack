		Lesson 03 : Developing Web Applications Using Servlets 
		
			Evolution of Web Application 
			
				It All Started with HTML 
				
				Scripting Was Introduced
				
				1.  Server Side Scritping
				
					a. CGI 
					
					b. Mod Perl 
					
					c. Servlets 
					
					d. ASP
					
					e. JSP
					
					f. JSF
					
					g. PHP
					
					h. ASP.Net 
					
						...
				
				2.  Client Side Scripting
				
					a. Java Script
					
					b. VB Script 
					
					
				Request Response Architecture 
			
			1.  Encapsulation of Client Details
			
					Gathering the Details About the Client. 
			
			2.  Request Processing Phase
			
					Middleware then Delegates the Request to the Respective Component Who Can intake the Request, Process the Request
			
			3.  Response Generation Phase 
			
					Component After Processing the Request, Generation of Response and it Hands Over to the Server, Server Inturn Hands it Back to the Client
					
		
				HTTP Protocol is Stateless Protocol 
			
				How do We Make HTTP Protocol as a Statefull Protocol
			
				1.  URL Rewriting

						www.abc.com 
						
						www.abc.com?jsessionid=dsfkjasdkj4545kdsfjksl
				
				2.  Cookies
				
						Is a Small Text File Containing Client Information, Sent To and Fro From Client to the Server and Server to the Client interms of Request's and Response's
				
				3.  Hidden Form Fields
				
						An Input component In HTML Form Fields 
				
				4.  HttpSession 
				
						Session : Period of Time [During which Client and Server Communicates With Each Other in terms of Request's and Response's ]
				
						Is a Session Object which is Created and Maintained on the Middleware 
						
							a.  Client Information 
							
							b.  User Information 
			
				
				HTTP Methods 
				
				1.  GET
				
				2.  POST
				
				3.  PUT
				
				4.  DELETE
				
				5.  HEAD
				
				6.  TRACE
				
				7.  OPTION 
				
				
				URL is Composed of 
				
				< Protocol > : // < IP Address > : < Port No > / AppName / ResName 
				
				http://localhost:9090/BankingApp/CustomerDetails.jsp
				
				
				Accession Application Using IP Address of the Server on Which Application is Deployed is lil Difficult to Remember 
				
				DNS [ Domain Naming Service ]
				
				www.iqgateway.com 
				
				[ IP Address : Port / AppName ]
				
				
			Lesson 04 : Developing Web Applications Using JSP 
			
				Phases In JSP

				1.  Translation Phase 
				
					PageCompileServlet Converts JSP Page into Servlets 
								
				2.  Request Processing Phase 
				
					Now Container Will Ask the Generated Servlet to Process the Request
