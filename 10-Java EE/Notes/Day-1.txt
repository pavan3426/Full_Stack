			Lesson 01 : Java EE 7 Fundamentals 
			
			Lesson 02 : Designing Java EE Applications
			
			
			Lesson 00 : Overview of Servers 
			
				Recap of Application Architectures 
				
				Multi Tier [ Multiple Layers ] 
			
				Client Tier
				
					Can Contain Presentation Logic
				
				Middleware 	
				
					Can Contain Presentation Logic
				
					Business Logic
				
				EIS  
				
					Persistence Logic 
					
				
				
				We Have a Brother / Genie Next to us [ Middleware / Container / Server ]
				
				What is a Middleware  ? 
				
					A Middleware is a Software Which Provides Lot of Services 
					
					
				Types : 
						
							Web Server 
							
								[ Web Tier ( Supports Only Web Components ) ]
							
								Eg : Apache Tomcat, JWS
							
							Application Server 
							
								[ Web Tier ( Supports Web Components ) ]
								
												+
												
								[ Business Tier ( Supports Business Components ) ]
							
								Eg : Oracle Weblogic , Oracle Glassfish, Oracle Application Server, IBM WebShphere, JBoss JBoss, 
								Wildfly, James ... 
								
						
						Services Provided By Middleware
						
						1. Instance Pooling
						
						2. Instance Passivation
						
						3. Database Connection Pooling
						
						4. Pre Cached Instances [ Load on Startup ]
						
						5. Life Cycle Management
						
						6. Security Management
						
						7. Transaction Management 
						
						8. Low Level Services 
						
							a. Exception Handling
							
							b. Multi Threading
							
							c. IO Interaction
							
						9.  Naming Services
						
						10. Timer Services
						
						11. Messaging Services
						
						12. Remoting Services
						
						13. Logging Services
						
						14. Request Response Delegation

				People Involved In JEE Application Development 
				
				1.	Development Team

					a.  Component Provider [ Developer ( WE )]
				
				2.  Production Team 
		
					a.  Server Provider [ Vendors ( Oracle, IBM, JBoss ) ]
					
					b.  Application Assembler 
					
					c.  Application Deployer
					
					d.  Application Server Administrator 
					
				In Web Applications Clients and Server Usally Communicate Using HTTP Protocol 
			
			
			1.  Client Details 
			
				Machine / Browser Which Invoked the Request 
				
				
			2.  User Details
					
				Details Pertaining to the User [ User = WE ]
			
			Request Response Architecture 
			
			1.  Encapsulation of Client Details
			
					Gathering the Details About the Client. 
			
			2.  Request Processing Phase
			
					Middleware then Delegates the Request to the Respective Component Who Can intake the Request, Process the Request
			
			3.  Response Generation Phase 
			
					Component After Processing the Request, Generation of Response ( Response Object is in Java Format ) With Formulation of Response ( Convertion of Java Object Containing the Response into the Respective Type ( Markup )) and it Hands Over to the Server, Server Inturn Hands it Back to the Client
