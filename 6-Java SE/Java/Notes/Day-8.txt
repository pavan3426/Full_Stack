			Why Prepared Statement ?
			
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'JAVA';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'TESTING';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'PHP';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = '.NET';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'C#';
				
				
			Reason Behind Prepared Statement [ Performance Improvement ]
			
				Instead of Converting the Whole Query FROM JAVA TO SQL 
				
				PreparedStatement maintains a PreCompiled QUERY [ Most Part of the Query Which is Common ]
				
				Only the Portion of the Query Which needs to Changed can be Parameterized and Only that Can be Converted From Java to SQL 
			
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = ?;
				
				
				
			Design Pattern 
			
				What is a Design  Pattern ?
				
					A Design Pattern is a Set of Guide Lines Given By One Developer to Another Developer in the S/W Industry for Recurring Problems
