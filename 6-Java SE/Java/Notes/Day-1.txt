Day 7

	Module 6 : Java SE 
	
	Softwares 
	
		1.  JDK
			[ 8 and 11 ]
			
			a.  JDE [ Java Development Environment ]
			
			b.  JRE [ Java Runtime Environment ]
		
		2.  Editor [ Notepad++ , EditPlus, ... ]
		
		3.  Best Friend [ Java Documentation ]
		
		
		What is a JAR File ?
		
			A Jar File is Compressed File [ Just Like .zip, .rar  ... ]
			
				Usally it contains Class Files [ Compiled Form of Java Source Files ]
		
		
		After JDK Installation it Becomes our Duty to Configure JDK
		
		Why Should we Configure ?
		
			To use the Right Version of Java
			
			
		JAVA_HOME : To the Dir Where Java is Installed

		Value	  : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121


		PATH	  : To the Dir Where Executables are available

		Value     : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121\bin;.;


		CLASSPATH : To the Dir Where Jar's are available

		Value     : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121\lib\tools.jar;.;D:\downloads\ojdbc14.jar;


			Priniciples of Object Oriented 
			
			1.  Classes and Objects 
			
			2.  Inheritance
			
			3.  Polymorphism
			
			4.  Abstraction
			
			5.  Encapsulation
			
			6.  Dynamic Binding 
			
			
			Java Application Architecture
			
			1.  Java Source Files  [ HelloWorld.java ]
			
			2.  Java Class Files   [ HelloWorld.class ]
			
			3.  Java API [ Application Programming Interface ] [ System, String, ... ]
			
			4.  Java Virtual Machine [ Execution Takes Place ]
			
					Stages in VM 
					
					a.  Class Loading Architecture
					
						In Which Programmer Provided Classes and Classes From API on Which Programmer Provided Class Was Dependent ON is LOADED
						
					
					b.  Execution Engine
					
						These Bytecodes are Interpreted By VM 
						
						
			
			
			Lesson 02 : Object Oriented Programming
			
				Composition 
				
					One Object is Composed of Another Object 
					
					Types 
					
					a.  Weak 
					
						Dependency is not Mandatory 
						
						When One Object is Not Completely Dependent on Another
						
						Eg : Car is Composed of Infotainment System 
						
					
					b.  Strong 
			
						Dependency is Mandatory
						
						When One Object is Completely Dependent on Another
						
						Eg: Car Body is Composed With Engine
