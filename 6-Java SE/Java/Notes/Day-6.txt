			Lesson 12: Arrays and Collections
			
				What is an Array ? 
				
					An Array is Contigeous Block of Memory Which is Reserved for a Particular Purpose
					
						Eg: Student Scores 
						
					Features of Arrays
					
					1.  Fixed in its Size [ Neither it Can Grow Nor it Can Shrink ]
					
					2.  Homogeneous [ Same Type ]
					
					3.  Arrays are Index Based, Array Starts with Index[0] Ends With Index[n-1]
					
				Arrays in Java 
				
				1.  Array of Primitives [ Array Which Holds Only Primitives ]
				
				2.  Array of Object Ref [ Array Which Holds Object References ]
				
					a.  Declaration of Array
					
						< DataType > < ArrayName > [];
						
						Customer[] customerArray;
						
						
					b.  Creation of Array Object
					
						customerArray = new Customer[10];
						
						
					c.  Initialization of an Array
					
						Way1  : Individually Create Objects and Later Store in Array
						
							Customer c1 = new Customer(1, "Rahul", "Indiranagar", "9876543210");
							
							
							customerArray[0] = c1; // Assigning One Ref to Another
							
							
						Way2 : On the go Creation [ When We Dont Need Separate ObjRef ]
						
							customerArray[1] = new Customer(2, "Imran", "Delhi" , "98765654434");
							
					
					ONE Shot Array of Object References
					
					Customer custArray[] = { 
			
								new Customer(1, "Rahul", "Indiranagar", "9876543210"),
								 
								new Customer(2, "Imran", "Delhi" , "98765654434")
								 
								}
								
			
			
				Multi Dimensional Array
				
					1.  Declaration of Array
					
						<type>[][]  <Array Name>;
						
						int[][] mdArray;
					
					2.  Creation of Array
					
						<Array name> = new <type>[][];
						
						mdArray = new int[4][2];
						
						How Do We Access ?
						
						 Index of Row , Then Index of Column in the Current Row 
						 
						 mdArray[0][0]
						 mdArray[2][1]
					
					
					If We Want Variable Size of Columns in Each Row
					
						1.  Declaration of Array
					
						<type>[][]  <Array Name>;
						
						int[][] mdArray;
					
					2.  Creation of Array
					
						<Array name> = new <type>[][EMPTY];
						
						mdArray = new int[4][];
					
						mdArray[0] = new int[10];
						
						mdArray[1] = new int[5]; 
						
						mdArray[2] = new int[20];
						
					
			Lesson 13 : Abstract Classes and Interfaces
			
				What is an Abstract Class ?
				
					An Abstract Class is Like Any Other Concrete Class [ Meaning Which Also has Properties and Methods ]
					
					Abstract Class Contains 
					
						a.  Concrete Methods [ Methods Which are Defined ]
						
						b.  Abstract Methods [ Methos Which are Declared ]
						
					Modifier Abstract  ( Method & Class )

					Why Abstract ?
					
					abstract class DBMSOperations
					{
					
						public void connectToDB() {
							Connects to Oracle DB
						}
						
						public abstract void executeOnDB(); 
						
						public void disconnectFromDB() {
							Disconnects From Oracle DB
						}
					}
					
					class InsertOperations extends DBMSOperations 
					{
						public void executeOnDB() {
							INSERT 
						}
					}
					
					class UpdateOperations extends DBMSOperations 
					{
						public void executeOnDB() {
							UPDATE 
						}
					}
					
					class DeleteOperations extends DBMSOperations 
					{
						public void executeOnDB() {
							DELETE
						}
					}
