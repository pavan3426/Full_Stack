			What is a Comment ? 
			
				Comments are Non Executable Statements Which are Used For Better Understanding and Readability
				
			How do We Give Comments in Java ?
			
				a.  Single Line Comment [ // ]
				
				b.  Multi Line Comment  [ /*    */ ]
				
				c.  Documentation Comment [ 
											/**
				                             *
											 *
											 */
										  ]
										  
				
				Comments are Information Given by a Developer to End User or Another Developer making them Understand About the Class/Component
				
				Annotations are Information Given By a Developer to a Tool [ Compiler / Interpreter ] to Do Something.
				
				Annotations Always Start With @
				
					@Override
					
					Why is this Required ?
					
					class DbmsOperations 
					{
						public void connectToDB() {
							sop("Connects to Oracle DB");
						}
						
						public void executeOnDB() {
							sop("SELECT");
						}
						
						public void disconnectFromDB(){
							sop("Disconnects From Oracle DB");
						}
						
					}
					
					class InsertOperations extends DbmsOperations 
					{
						@Override

							sop("INSERT");
						}
					
					}
					
					@SupressWarning
