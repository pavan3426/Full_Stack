		Module 11 : Application Development Using Web Services [ SOAP and REST ]
		
			Lesson 01 : Introduction to Web Services 
			
			Lesson 02 : XML Document Structure 
			
			Lesson 03 : XML Parsing Using JAXB 
			
			
			Lesson 01 : Introduction to Web Services 
			
				People Involved in Java EE Development 
				
					1.  Development Environment 
					
						a. Component Provider 
						
					2.  Production Environment
					
						a. Application Server Provider 
						
						b. Application Assembler 
						
						c. Application Deployer
						
						d. Application Server Administrator 
						
						
				Now We will Install Application Server 
				
					1.  Download the App Server Software From the Vendor Provider Location 
					
						fmw_12_2_1_WLS_DISK_1.zip
						
					
					2.  Unpack this File Leads into a Jar File 
					
						fmw_12_2_1.0.0_wls.jar
						
					3.  Run this Jar File to Install the App Server 
					
						Follow the Steps and Install It 
						
					
				What is a Web Service ?
				
					Web [ Over the Globe ]
					
					Service [ Execution ]
					
				RPC [ Remote Procedure Call ]
				
					Cross System Execution [ Client can Be On One Machine , Execution Logic Can Be Another Machine ]
					
				RMI [ Remote Method Invocation ]
				
					One JVM Invokes a Method on Another JVM 
					
				
				Whether it is RMI, .Net Remoting, CORBA [ Both Client and Executor Should be Defined in the Same Language ]
				
				Many of the Remoting Technologies do Suffer From Problems
				
				1. Platform Specific 
				
					If Logic is built in Java, Then The Client Who is Accessing the Logic Should also Be in Java [ For Example ]
					
				2.  Complexity [ Need of Rewriting the Logic Again & Again in the Respective Form ]
				
				
			Web Service Acts as Solution for This Problem.
			
				Client You Be on Any End [ Platform ], Executor You Be on Any End [ Platform ].
				
				But Still Communication Happens Between Them 
				
					Mediator / Bridge  ( Web Services { SOAP or REST } Uses [ XML/JSON ] for Data Transfers )
