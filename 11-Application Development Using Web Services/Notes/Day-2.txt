				Lesson 04 : SOAP Web Services Overview 
				
					Webservices 
					
						a.  SOAP Based

						<portType>: Describes a Web service, the operations that can be performed, and 	the messages that are involved
						
						
						<binding>: Defines the communication protocols used by the Web service
