			Lesson 08 : Bottom Up Approach JAX WS 
			
				SOAP Based WS Can Be Built in 
				
				1.  Bottom Up Approach
				
				2.  Top Down Approach 
							
				This is one of the Way to Create a SOAP Based WS 
				
					Bottom Up Approach Indicates
					
						1. Business Logic Defined First [ In Our Case its in Java ]
						
						2. Generate WSDL [ Auto Generated ]
						
						3. Construct Client App [ UI also JAXB Classes ]
						
					Top Down Approach Indicates
						
						1. We Will Generate WSDL [ Created By Developer ]
						
						2. Business Logic Defined Based on WSDL [ In Our Case its in Java ] 
							
							Skeleton for the Application is Generated, Developer Needs to Add the Logic 
						
						3. Construct Client App [ UI also JAXB Classes ]
				
						
						
				Lesson 09 : Top Down Approach 
						
					
					A WSDL [ Web Service Description Language ]
						
						
						<types>: Defines the data types used by the Web service
						
						<message>: Describes the messages used by the Web service; defines the data elements of an operation
												
						
						<portType>: Describes a Web service, the operations that can be performed, and 	the messages that are involved
						
						
						<binding>: Defines the communication protocols used by the Web service
						
						
						<service>: Describes the name and location of the Web service and the context with which it can be accessed
						
						
				Lesson 10 : Implementing JAX RS Web Services 
				
					A Restful WS Application is Composed of Collection of Resources 
					
						Each Resource is a Business Class [ Entity ] Containing Business Operations Marked With HTTP Annotations on it.
						
					
					A RESTFul Application [ Banking ]
					
						Collection of Resources 
						
							CustomerResource  ---- Business Operations Associated With Customer
							
							AccountResource  ---- Business Operations Associated With Account
							
							TransactionResource  ---- Business Operations Associated With Transaction
							
							...
