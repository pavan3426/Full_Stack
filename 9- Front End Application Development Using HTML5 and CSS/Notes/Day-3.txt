				Why CSS ?
				
					A Pure Separation of Concern Where We Separate Markup With Styling 
					
					Earlier to CSS 
					
						With Markup We Used to Have Style Factors Defined, But As Applications Became Complex, We Expected
						
							1.  Reusable
							
							2.  Separation 
							
						
						How to Apply to Styles to the Markup 
						
						1.  Element Level Styling / Inline Style
						
							<h1 style="color: blue">
						
						2.  Page Level Styling / Embedded Style
						
							<style>
								body {
									font-family: Arial, Helvitica, Sans-serif;
									background-color: #d9e7f2;
									padding: 10px;
									border: 0px;
									margin: 30px;
								}
								
								...
							
							</style>
							
						3.  Application Level Styling 
							
							Can Create a Separate CSS File Containing All the Style Defination , So that it Can Plugged into Any Page of the Application Using 
							
							a.  <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css">
							
							b.  <style>
							
									@import(url="default.css")
								
								</style>
								
						
						
					What Does a Style Defination Contains
						
						1.  Rule 
						
							a.  Selector 
							
								i.  Declaration of Style
								
										Property : Value 
										
										
							Eg :
							
								h1 { 
								
									background-color: crimson;
									color: gold;
									
								}
						
						
					Lengths and Measurements
					
					Two Kinds of Measurements
					
						1.  Relative
						
								Depends on the Environment in which they are Used.
								Such as Systems Monitor's Screen Resolutions or the Size of the Font.
								
								em --- Length Relavant to the Nearest Font Size
								
								ex --- x-height of the Relavant font Form ( Height of Letter )
						
								px --- Pixels, Relative to the Viewing Devices 
								
								%  --- Percentage Measurements, Calculated Based on the % Measurements [ 12px = 100% ] [ 18px = 150% ]
								
						2.  Absolute 
						
								Not Dependent on Any Other Measurements, Absolute Measurements retain the Length Regardless of the Environment. ( Such as Systems Monitor's Screen Resolutions or the Size of the Font.
								
								
									in --- Inches
									
									cm --- Centimeters
									
									mm --- Millimeters
									
									pt --- Points [ 1 Point = 1/72nd Inches ]
									
									pc --- Picas [ 1 Pica = 12 Points ]
									
				Selectors

					1.  HTML Element Name
					
					2.  Class Level 
					
							Applying Style to Multiple HTML Elements Across 
					
					3.  ID Level [ Page Specific ]
					
							Applying Style Only to One Element Through out the Page 
					
					
					BOX Model 
					
						Has 3 Main Parts
						
						1.  Margin 
						
						2.  Border 
						
						3.  Padding
