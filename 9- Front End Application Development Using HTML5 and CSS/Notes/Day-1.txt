			Multi Tier [ Multiple Layers ] 
			
				Client Tier
				
					Can Contain Presentation Logic
				
				Middleware 	
				
					Can Contain Presentation Logic
				
					Business Logic
				
				EIS  
				
					Persistence Logic 
					
					
				What is a Middleware ?
					
						A Middleware is a Software Which Provides Lot of Services
						
						Types : 
						
							Web Server 
							
								[ Web Tier ( Supports Only Web Components ) ]
							
								Eg : Apache Tomcat, JWS
							
							Application Server 
							
								[ Web Tier ( Supports Web Components ) ]
								
												+
												
								[ Business Tier ( Supports Business Components ) ]
							
								Eg : Oracle Weblogic , Oracle Glassfish, Oracle Application Server, IBM WebShphere, JBoss JBoss, 
								Wildfly, James ... 
								
						
						Services Provided By Middleware
						
						1. Instance Pooling
						
						2. Instance Passivation
						
						3. Database Connection Pooling
						
						4. Pre Cached Instances [ Load on Startup ]
						
						5. Life Cycle Management
						
						6. Security Management
						
						7. Transaction Management 
						
						8. Low Level Services 
						
							a. Exception Handling
							
							b. Multi Threading
							
							c. IO Interaction
							
						9.  Naming Services
						
						10. Timer Services
						
						11. Messaging Services
						
						12. Remoting Services
						
						13. Logging Services
						
						14. Request Response Delegation 
						
							...
			
			
			HTTP [ Hyper Text Transfer Protocol ]
			
			In Web Applications Clients and Server Usally Communicate Using HTTP Protocol 
			
			
			1.  Client Details 
			
				Machine / Browser Which Invoked the Request 
				
				
			2.  User Details
					
				Details Pertaining to the User [ User = WE ]
			
			Request Response Architecture 
			
			1.  Encapsulation of Client Details
			
					Gathering the Details About the Client. 
			
			2.  Request Processing Phase
			
					Middleware then Delegates the Request to the Respective Component Who Can intake the Request, Process the Request
			
			3.  Response Generation Phase 
			
					Component After Processing the Request, Generation of Response and it Hands Over to the Server, Server Inturn Hands it Back to the Client
			
			
			HTTP Protocol is Stateless Protocol 
			
			How do We Make HTTP Protocol as a Statefull Protocol
			
				1.  URL Rewriting

						www.abc.com 
						
						www.abc.com?jsessionid=dsfkjasdkj4545kdsfjksl
				
				2.  Cookies
				
						Is a Small Text File Containing Client Information, Sent To and Fro From Client to the Server and Server to the Client interms of Request's and Response's
				
				3.  Hidden Form Fields
				
						An Input component In HTML Form Fields 
				
				4.  HttpSession 
				
						Session : Period of Time [During which Client and Server Communicates With Each Other in terms of Request's and Response's ]
				
						Is a Session Object which is Created and Maintained on the Middleware 
						
							a.  Client Information 
							
							b.  User Information 
			
				
				HTTP Methods 
				
				1.  GET
				
				2.  POST
				
				3.  PUT
				
				4.  DELETE
				
				5.  HEAD
				
				6.  TRACE
				
				7.  OPTION 
				
				
				URL is Composed of 
				
				< Protocol > : // < IP Address > : < Port No > / AppName / ResName 
				
				http://localhost:9090/BankingApp/CustomerDetails.jsp
				
				
				Accession Application Using IP Address of the Server on Which Application is Deployed is lil Difficult to Remember 
				
				DNS [ Domain Naming Service ]
				
				www.iqgateway.com 
				
				[ IP Address : Port / AppName ]
				
				
				Tags / Elements 
				
				1.  Tag With Body With Attributes
				
					<body bgcolor="pink">
						Welcome to Web Application 
					</body>
				
				2.  Tag Without Body With Attributes
				
					<img src="c:/myProfile.jpg" />
				
				3.  Tag With Body Without Attributes
					
					<p>
						This a Paragraph
					</p>
					
				
				4.  Tag Without Body Without Attributes
				
					<br> 
					
				http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
				
				
				Tag / Element 
				
					Is Like a Functionality to Perform 
					
					<h1> Title </h1>
					
				
				Markup Languages 
				
				
					Pre Defined Tags
					
						html 
					
					User Defined Tags 
					
						xml 
				
				
				Java Script is MIX of ALL 
				
				Sometimes it is 
				
					1.  Traditional Language [ Contains Just the Statements ]
					
					2.  Procedural [ Made up of Methods / Functions ]
					
					3.  Object Based [ Made Up of Classes and Objects ]
