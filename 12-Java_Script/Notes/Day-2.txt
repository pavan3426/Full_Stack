			Lesson 03 : BOM and DOM 
			
				BOM [ Browser Object Model ]
				
				Window

						outerWidth
						outerHeight

						confirm()
						open()
						prompt()
						
						...

					Properties
					
						host 
						hostName
						pathName
						protocol
						href [ Represents a URL ]

					Properties 
					
						availHeight
						
						availWidth
						
						availLeft
						
						availRight
						
						colorDepth
						
						height
						
						width 
						
						
				Lesson 04 : JavaScript Events
				
						Events 
			
						1.  Diretly Via HTML
				
						2.  Through DOM 
						
						What is an Event ? 
			
							An Event is an Interaction Between Client and the Application 
						
							Any GUI Application Without Events is Incomplete
						
							What all Components are Part of the Event ?
					
								a. UI Component 
								
								b. Event Listener  
								
								c. Event Handler 
								
							Firstly We need to Add Event Listener on the UI Component, So its Constantly Listening for a Particular Type of Event.
						
							When an Event is fired/Triggered, the Next Moment Event Object is Constructed and Passed on to the Event Handler 
						
							Contents of Event Object 
						
							1.  Source Component which has raised the Event
							
							2.  Category of the Event 
							
							3.  Time/Sequence of the Event 
							
							Thirdly the Event Handler Receives the Event Object as Parameter, Event Handler is the Place, Where What is Needs to Be Done is Defined [ Action ]
						
					
				Lesson 05 : Closures and Prototypes

						A Function with in an Another Function Leads into a Closure 
						
							Why ?
							
								To Enforce Strong Relationships Between Function 
								
								Availability of One Function is ONLY Within the Other
