				Usage of With 
				
				class DBMSOperations
				{ 
				
					function connectToDB() {
						Connects to Oracle DB
					}
					
					function executeOnDB() {
						SELECT
					}
					
					function disConnectFromDB() {
						Disconnects From Oracle DB
					}
					
				}
				
				// Creating an Object
				var dbmsObjRef = new DBMSOperations();
				
				// Invoking Methods 
				dbmsObjRef.connectToDB();
				dbmsObjRef.executeOnDB();
				dbmsObjRef.disConnectFromDB();
				
				
				Usage of With 
				
				with(dbmsObjRef.specs) {
				
					connectToDB();
					executeOnDB();
					disConnectFromDB();
					
				}
				
				
				Objects in JavaScript Can Be Created 
				
				1.  Empty Object 
				
					var emptyObjRef = {
					
					}
					
					
					var emptyObjRef1 = new Object();
					
					var emptyObjRef2 = Object.create(null);
					
				
				2.  Singleton Object 
				
				
				3.  Objects Can Be Constructed using Constructor Look and Feel 
				
				
				Anonymous Function 
				
					Function Without a Name
